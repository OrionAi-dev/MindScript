# Behave Mapper

This adapter connects MindScript `@software` criteria to **Behave** by **referencing external artifacts only**. It does **not** embed or generate Gherkin steps from MindScript. Instead, it verifies links to Behave `.feature` files and `Scenario`s you reference, and produces a traceability index.

## Design principles

- **MindScript stays agnostic.** We only link to Behave; we do not copy Gherkin semantics into MindScript.
- **References over generation.** The mapper verifies and indexes your references; it does not author steps or features.
- **Profiles by URL.** `bdd_ref.source` must be a URL listed in `bdd-registry.yaml` (e.g., Behave).

## What it does

- Reads an MindScript YAML that declares:
  - `profile: https://mindscript.dev/profiles/@software`
  - One or more criteria with `bdd_ref` pointing to Behave artifacts
- For each criterion with `bdd_ref`:
  - Validates `bdd_ref.source` matches the Behave profile URL in your registry
  - Resolves `bdd_ref.path` to a `.feature` (local file or URL)
  - Confirms the named `bdd_ref.scenario` exists in that file
  - Records the linkage in `dist/behave/index.json` for traceability
- Optionally copies the referenced `.feature` files into `dist/behave/features/` **without modification** for distribution

## Inputs (required fields)

- `criteria[].bdd_ref.source` → Behave profile URL  
  Example: `https://mindscript.dev/profiles/bdd/behave`
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.path` → path/URL to the `.feature`
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.scenario` → scenario name inside that feature

> Note: Inline step fields such as `given`, `when`, `then` are **not used**. The mapper ignores them if present.

## Minimal example (MindScript → Behave reference)

MindScript input:

```yaml
profile: https://mindscript.dev/profiles/@software
kind: software
meta:
  id: BEHAVE-301
  title: User login with Behave
  owner: app-auth
  priority: P1
  labels: [behave, python]

requirements:
  - id: BEHAVE-301.1
    statement: Behave scenario is bound to Python steps
    criteria:
      - id: BEHAVE-301.1.1
        type: functional
        text: Valid credentials produce a successful session
        bdd_ref:
          source: https://mindscript.dev/profiles/bdd/behave
          path: ./BEHAVE-LOGIN.feature
          scenario: Valid credentials produce a successful session
```

Behave feature (referenced, maintained in your repo; **not generated by the mapper**):

```gherkin
Feature: BEHAVE-301 User login with Behave
  Scenario: Valid credentials produce a successful session
    Given a registered user with a verified email
    When the user submits valid credentials
    Then the app creates a session and redirects to the dashboard
```

Mapper output (traceability index):

```json
{
  "profile": "https://mindscript.dev/profiles/@software",
  "tool": "behave",
  "mappings": [
    {
      "criteria_id": "BEHAVE-301.1.1",
      "feature": "docs/mindscript/implementations/@software/examples/BEHAVE-LOGIN.feature",
      "scenario": "Valid credentials produce a successful session"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Field mapping (reference-only)

MindScript → Behave

- `meta.id`, `meta.title` → used for discovery and file naming; **no content is generated**
- `requirements[].id`, `requirements[].statement` → used for grouping in the index
- `criteria[].id`, `criteria[].text` → used for index entries
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.source` → must match the Behave profile URL in `bdd-registry.yaml`
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.path` → `.feature` file location
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.scenario` → Scenario name within that `.feature`

## File layout

**Inputs**
- MindScript specs: anywhere (examples under `docs/mindscript/implementations/@software/examples/`)
- Behave features: wherever your test suite keeps them; examples live alongside the YAML

**Outputs**
- Traceability index → `dist/behave/index.json`
- Optional copied features (unchanged) → `dist/behave/features/`

## Validation rules applied

- MindScript file must validate against `@software` schema
- `bdd_ref.source` must be a URL listed under Behave in `bdd-registry.yaml`
- `bdd_ref.path` must resolve to an existing `.feature` (local or reachable URL)
- `bdd_ref.scenario` must exist in the target `.feature`
- Inline step fields are ignored; MindScript does **not** define steps

## Naming guidance

- If features are copied, default filename is `<meta.id>.feature` unless a collision occurs; then the original filename is preserved
- Index keys use `criteria.id` as the stable identifier

## Integration tips

- Place your Behave step definitions under `features/steps/`
- Tag scenarios with MindScript IDs for easier back-references:

```gherkin
@mindscript(BEHAVE-301.1.1)
Scenario: Valid credentials produce a successful session
```

- Persist `dist/behave/index.json` as a CI artifact for traceability
- Typical Behave run command (for docs): `behave -q`

## Limitations

- The mapper does **not** generate or modify `.feature` content or Python step definitions
- It does not handle authenticated remote URLs unless your CLI adds credentials
- Assumes UTF-8 and standard Gherkin keywords

## Quick checklist

- [ ] MindScript YAML validates against `@software` schema  
- [ ] `bdd-registry.yaml` includes the Behave profile URL  
- [ ] External `.feature` file exists and contains the named Scenario  
- [ ] `dist/behave/index.json` produced for traceability  
- [ ] (Optional) Features copied to `dist/behave/features/` without modification
