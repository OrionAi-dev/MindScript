# JBehave Mapper

This adapter connects OpenSpec `@software` criteria to **JBehave** by **referencing external artifacts only**. It does **not** embed or generate `.story` content from OpenSpec. Instead, it verifies links to JBehave `.story` files and `Scenario`s you reference, and produces a traceability index.

## Design principles

- **OpenSpec stays agnostic.** We only link to JBehave; we do not copy JBehave semantics into OpenSpec.
- **References over generation.** The mapper verifies and indexes your references; it does not author stories or Java steps.
- **Profiles by URL.** `bdd_ref.source` must be a URL listed in `bdd-registry.yaml` (e.g., JBehave).

## What it does

- Reads an OpenSpec YAML that declares:
  - `profile: https://openspec.dev/profiles/@software`
  - One or more criteria with `bdd_ref` pointing to JBehave artifacts
- For each criterion with `bdd_ref`:
  - Validates `bdd_ref.source` matches the JBehave profile URL from your registry
  - Resolves `bdd_ref.path` to a `.story` (local file or URL)
  - Confirms the named `bdd_ref.scenario` exists in that file
  - Records the linkage in `dist/jbehave/index.json` for traceability
- Optionally copies the referenced `.story` files into `dist/jbehave/stories/` **without modification** for distribution

## Inputs (required fields)

- `criteria[].bdd_ref.source` → JBehave profile URL  
  Example: `https://openspec.dev/profiles/bdd/jbehave`
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.path` → path/URL to the `.story`
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.scenario` → scenario name inside that story

> Note: Inline step fields such as `given`, `when`, `then` are **not used**. The mapper ignores them if present.

## Minimal example (OpenSpec → JBehave reference)

OpenSpec input:

```yaml
profile: https://openspec.dev/profiles/@software
kind: software
meta:
  id: JBEHAVE-401
  title: User login with JBehave
  owner: app-auth
  priority: P2
  labels: [jbehave, java]

requirements:
  - id: JBEHAVE-401.1
    statement: JBehave story is bound to Java steps
    criteria:
      - id: JBEHAVE-401.1.1
        type: functional
        text: JBehave story executes the login flow
        bdd_ref:
          source: https://openspec.dev/profiles/bdd/jbehave
          path: ./JBEHAVE-LOGIN.story
          scenario: Valid credentials produce a successful session
```

JBehave story (referenced, maintained in your repo; **not generated by the mapper**):

```
Scenario: Valid credentials produce a successful session
Given a registered user with a verified email
When the user submits valid credentials
Then the app creates a session and redirects to the dashboard
```

Mapper output (traceability index):

```json
{
  "profile": "https://openspec.dev/profiles/@software",
  "tool": "jbehave",
  "mappings": [
    {
      "criteria_id": "JBEHAVE-401.1.1",
      "story": "docs/openspec/implementations/@software/examples/JBEHAVE-LOGIN.story",
      "scenario": "Valid credentials produce a successful session"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Field mapping (reference-only)

OpenSpec → JBehave

- `meta.id`, `meta.title` → used for discovery and file naming; **no content is generated**
- `requirements[].id`, `requirements[].statement` → used for grouping in the index
- `criteria[].id`, `criteria[].text` → used for index entries
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.source` → must match the JBehave profile URL in `bdd-registry.yaml`
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.path` → `.story` file location
- `criteria[].bdd_ref.scenario` → `Scenario:` name within that `.story`

## File layout

**Inputs**
- OpenSpec specs: anywhere (examples under `docs/openspec/implementations/@software/examples/`)
- JBehave stories: wherever your test suite keeps them; examples live alongside the YAML

**Outputs**
- Traceability index → `dist/jbehave/index.json`
- Optional copied stories (unchanged) → `dist/jbehave/stories/`

## Validation rules applied

- OpenSpec file must validate against `@software` schema
- `bdd_ref.source` must be a URL listed under JBehave in `bdd-registry.yaml`
- `bdd_ref.path` must resolve to an existing `.story` (local or reachable URL)
- `bdd_ref.scenario` must exist in the target `.story`
- Inline step fields are ignored; OpenSpec does **not** define steps

## Naming guidance

- If stories are copied, default filename is `<meta.id>.story` unless a collision occurs; then the original filename is preserved
- Index keys use `criteria.id` as the stable identifier

## Integration tips

- Keep JBehave step classes in your Java test sources (e.g., `src/test/java/...`)
- Typical execution via Maven Surefire or JUnit runners
- Tag scenarios with OpenSpec IDs in comments if you want back-references:

```
!-- @openspec(JBEHAVE-401.1.1)
Scenario: Valid credentials produce a successful session
```

- Persist `dist/jbehave/index.json` as a CI artifact for traceability

## Limitations

- The mapper does **not** generate or modify `.story` content or Java step definitions
- It does not handle authenticated remote URLs unless your CLI adds credentials
- Assumes UTF-8 and standard JBehave keywords

## Quick checklist

- [ ] OpenSpec YAML validates against `@software` schema  
- [ ] `bdd-registry.yaml` includes the JBehave profile URL  
- [ ] External `.story` file exists and contains the named Scenario  
- [ ] `dist/jbehave/index.json` produced for traceability  
- [ ] (Optional) Stories copied to `dist/jbehave/stories/` without modification
